# 📊 Hypothesis Tester AI

An **interactive AI-powered data analysis tool** built with **Streamlit** that helps users perform **hypothesis testing** on their datasets.  
Upload your data, ask questions in **natural language**, and get **statistical test results with visualizations** — all in one place.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 💬 **Chat-like Interface** – interact with your dataset using natural language.  
- 📂 **Upload Your Dataset** – CSV/XLSX support.  
- 🧪 **Hypothesis Testing** – run common statistical tests such as:
  - t-test (one-sample, two-sample, paired)
  - ANOVA
  - One-Sample Z-test
  - Chi-Square
  - Correlation tests (Pearson, Spearman)
  - Proportions Z-test
- 📊 **Visual Cues** – auto-generated plots with rejection regions and significance highlights.  
- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Explanation** *(future)* – ask the AI to explain test results in plain English.  
- 🌐 **Domain-Agnostic** – works across finance, healthcare, marketing, education, and more.
